# Face recognition
This is my project on face recognition. This is the alpha version so to speak. The idea of the project is to allow you to separate photos that you are on from those where there is no you from a collection of photos.
In order to do so you need to provide some photos of your face -> a photo where there is only you. The more of these photos the better.
